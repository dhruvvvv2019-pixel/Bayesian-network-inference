# Bayesian-network-inference
A C++ implementation of Bayesian Network inference demonstrating probabilistic reasoning using graphical models.

This repository contains a C++ implementation of Bayesian Networks, developed to model and perform inference over probabilistic graphical models. The project focuses on representing conditional dependencies between random variables using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and computing probabilistic outcomes based on given evidence.
The implementation emphasizes:

1.Core C++ programming

2.Algorithmic clarity

3.Explicit handling of probabilities and conditional dependencies

4.Clean separation of logic for node representation, probability tables, and inference computation

This project demonstrates strong fundamentals in AI reasoning systems, data structures, and low-level algorithmic implementation, making it suitable for software engineering and AI-oriented roles.
